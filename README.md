This directory contains all the images obtained by running the code. The name format of the image is "image type@number", for example, "HF@3" is the heat flow image numbered 3. There are 324 heat flow images, 324 T images, and 81 direction images. The direction image is only numbered 4i+1, because direction is independent of the value of Np, so it will not be updated every time Np is updated. Images with the same number come from the same set of parameters.
